# Tailwind CSS

All reports in this repository share a single CSS file by default, and the content of this file is managed by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). This is a CSS framework that works with a very large number of minimal classes, which makes the styling very flexible without you having to write a single line of CSS. Since only the classes that are actually being used are included, the size of the resulting file can be kept down.

## Setup

Tailwind is available through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss), but since there are no other Node.js dependencies in this project, it is recommended that you install the [standalone CLI tool](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli) instead. The binaries for various systems are [hosted on Github](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases). Here is how to install on Linux:

```bash
curl -sLO https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/download/v3.3.6/tailwindcss-linux-x64
chmod +x tailwindcss-linux-x64
mv tailwindcss-linux-x64 tailwindcss
```

Preferrably move this binary to a directory in your `$PATH`. Depending on the platform, the installation procedure might look different.

## Usage

The Tailwind configuration can be found in `tailwind.config.js`. By default, it will look for classes in all HTML and JS files in the `workflow/templates` directory. When actively working on a template, it is recommended that Tailwind is set to watch files for changes and edit the CSS file as it goes:

```bash
tailwindcss \
    -i ./workflow/templates/assets/css/tailwind.css \
    -o ./workflow/templates/assets/css/main.css \
    --watch
```

In the example above, `./workflow/templates/assets/css/tailwind.css` is the input css file, and `./workflow/templates/assets/css/main.css` is the output css file which is used in the each template. This approach will make certain that each and every Tailwind class in use is available in the generated CSS file, and at the same time remove any unused classes.

When including this file in a template, it is recommended that it is minified. In order to keep the git history clean, the minified CSS should not be committed to the repo, but rather be something that is generated by the script of each individual report. <!-- TODO: add a reference to an example, as soon as there is one -->
